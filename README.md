# Orbital Object Classification and Analysis

The dataset contains information about various space objects, such as their type (e.g., payload, debris), physical characteristics, and orbital parameters. I employed methods including data preprocessing, feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, and hypothesis testing to compare the performance of logistic regression with and without polynomial features.

# Space Debris Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify space objects (payloads vs. debris) using logistic regression. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and model tuning.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks.
- `src/`: Contains the Python scripts.
- `img/`: Contains plots, graphs, and other images
