The dataset contains information about various space objects, such as their type (e.g., payload, debris), physical characteristics, and orbital parameters. I employed methods including data preprocessing, feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, and hypothesis testing to compare the performance of logistic regression with and without polynomial features.
